# Coffee Shop Code Challenge

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Code Challenge repository! This project is a code challenge for school. Below are instructions to set up and run the project.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Version 3.x)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yasir-moha/coffe-shop-code-challenge.git` 

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    
    Change your directory to the project folder:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd coffe-shop-code-challenge` 
    
3.  **Install Dependencies**
    
    Use `pipenv` to install the project's dependencies:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `pipenv install` 
    
    This command will create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages as defined in the `Pipfile.lock`.
    

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project by activating the virtual environment and executing the main script.

1.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `pipenv shell` 
    
2.  **Run the Main Script**
    
    Execute the script to start the application:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `python solution.py`
